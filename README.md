 |          The Tool for Optimization in Thermodynamic              |
 |__________________________________________________________________|
-->

In this repository new and AI-enhanced Optimization algorithms will be forged.
Furthermore this tool streamlines the optimization for Thermodynamic Modeling.

## Features

- Particle Swarm Optimizer (with output to log.csv file)
- Added PSO convergence and outflags
- Matlab plot-function for PSO
- RL enforced PSO
- Genetic Algorithm (with output to log.csv file)
- Added GA convergence and outflags
- Matlab plot-function for GA
- Downhill Simplex optimization algorithm
- Sigmoid variable transformation


 ## Notes
Here you can see Bugs, Warnings and other Notes regarding the CallClass and its tools
- getVals function in PSO not tested!
- Simplex bind2nd changed to bind
